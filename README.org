* RShell

This shell aims to be minimal as possible.

** Install

*** From the autobuild system

	You can go on you prefered package system and run make,
	to use a build system, build tools are needed, e.g, for 
    rpm you need rpmbuild,  and you need to set enviroment 
    variable VERSION to the version you want.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
set VERSION 2.0 # RShell set enviroment command
make
#+END_SRC

*** From Makefile

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make
sudo make install # maybe not, you can get elf from ./build/rshell
#+END_SRC

** Config

You can set the configuration by using enviroment variables, as the rshell
don't have a config file, you may set it in .profile.

*** Prompt
   
   The prompt is set in the RSHELL_PROMPT enviroment variable.

   Woking tokens:
   - %D will set debug mode
   - %d will show the path to the current working dir
   - %u will show the user name

#+begin_example
RSHELL_PROMPT='[ %u - %d ] $ '
#+end_example
