* RShell
This shell aims to be minimal as possible.
** Install
You can find packages in Release or you can compile it yourself
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make
sudo install ./build/rshell /usr/bin/rshell
#+END_SRC
** Config
You can set the configuration by using enviroment variables, as the rshell
don't have a config file, you may set it in .profile.
*** Prompt
   The prompt is set in the RSHELL_PROMPT enviroment variable.

   Woking tokens:
   - %D will set debug mode
   - %d will show the path to the current working dir
   - %u will show the user name
#+begin_example
RSHELL_PROMPT='[ %u - %d ] $ '
#+end_example
*** Aliases
They can be defined in the .profile file as a normal enviroment variable,
and are called with the ':' prefix.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
export e="emacsclient -nw -c"
#+END_SRC
On the shell:
#+begin_example
rshell$ :e .profile
#+end_example
